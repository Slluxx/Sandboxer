Windows Sandbox restricts users to a single Logon command, which can be quite limiting. While batch or PowerShell scripts offer some flexibility, they quickly reach their limits. For instance, if you need to set up a C++ toolchain or install WinGet and PowerShell 7 -but not simultaneously- the process becomes cumbersome. The more tasks you add, the more complicated and messy it gets. Even with a mounted script folder, you still need to set the execution policy and make other adjustments that can be unnatural and tedious to edit.

### Meet Sandboxer

Sandboxer is a C# tool featuring a user-friendly GUI with several built-in PowerShell scripts. You can easily extend the list of available scripts by adding your own to the `.\scripts\` directory. All scripts run with "ExecutionPolicy Bypass," ensuring they execute seamlessly without affecting the broader system scope.


There are two versions available:

- Lightweight Executable: If .NET 8 is installed on your machine, you can use the compact 5MB version of Sandboxer. This version leverages the existing .NET runtime, ensuring minimal disk space usage and faster startup times.

- Self-contained Executable: If .NET 8 is not installed, you will need to use the self-contained "full" version of Sandboxer. This version includes all necessary runtime components, ensuring Sandboxer runs smoothly on any system, albeit with a larger file size.

These options provide flexibility, allowing you to choose the version that best suits your system's capabilities and your preferences.


## Building

To build Sandboxer, you'll need the .NET SDK 8. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `.\src` directory.
3. Run `dotnet build` for a standard build or `dotnet build -c NNL` for the lightweight version. Alternatively, you can use the `dotnet publish` command for creating deployable packages.

Note: The `csproj` file might need some adjustments, and contributions via pull requests are welcome.
